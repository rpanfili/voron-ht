# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One
# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in
# the stepper_z config section.
[probe]
pin: ^z:PROBE
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: 25
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 3.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
samples: 4
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
sample_retract_dist: 3
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
lift_speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
samples_tolerance: 0.006
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.
